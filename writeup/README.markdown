These files are the human-readable source of the [Prote.cs writeup](http://dirigibleFlightcraft.com/prote.cs/).
The writeup is integrated with my website, so these files are provided for educational reasons more so than for you-getting-everything-to-compile reasons.

The `.coffee` files are written in Jeremy Ashkenas's excellent CoffeeScript, which is a nice lil' language that compiles down into JavaScript.
These files contain example and results data and the visualization code.
The `.haml` files compile into HTML, and `.sass` into css.

`Three.js` is a minified version of Mr. Doob's JavaScript 3d rendering engine, which I used for the spinning protein on the main page.
